## Craft rules — apply in every direction

- **Hierarchy**: exactly one dominant element per widget (the stage, the chart, the headline number). Everything else is visibly subordinate — smaller, dimmer, or set aside. If two things compete, demote one.
- **Spacing rhythm**: all gaps and padding from the 4px scale — 8/12/16/20/24/32. Whitespace groups related things; inconsistent gaps read as sloppy.
- **Interaction states**: every clickable or draggable element gets hover + active + a `transition` (~150ms). A flat dead button is the fastest way to look cheap. Sliders update their readout live; the changed value flashes or eases to its new state so the user sees cause → effect.
- **Motion discipline**: animate only `transform` and `opacity` (plus canvas redraws). Durations from the direction spec. Loops gated behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`. Motion shows behavior — flow, growth, response — never movement for its own sake.
- **Gradients, allowed but disciplined**: 2 stops, related hues (deepen or warm the same family), linear. Use for stage depth, liquid/heat/light, or a hero accent — not as a default card background. No rainbow meshes.
- **Shadows**: either layered-soft (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.08), 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.06)`) or hard-offset (studio-pop). Never one huge blurry drop shadow.
- **Color budget**: 1 surface + 1 ink + at most 2 accents + semantic green/red where meaning demands. Accents encode meaning (state, category, delta) — not decoration.
- **Numbers**: every displayed number goes through `Math.round()` / `.toFixed(n)` / `Intl.NumberFormat` — float artifacts (`0.30000000000000004`) destroy credibility. Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for anything that updates.
- **Typography**: no font below 11px. Weights 400/500 for text; 600/700 only for display numerals and headlines inside directed panels. Sentence case for labels. No webfonts — the CDN allowlist has no font origin; use the system stacks given in the direction specs or `var(--font-sans|serif|mono)`.
- **Icons**: prefer small inline SVG paths or CSS shapes over emoji. Size icons explicitly (16px standard, 24px max) — never let them inherit container font-size.
- **First paint is meaningful**: the initial render shows real content in a sensible default state — never a blank stage with "click to start".

### Beauty check — run before emitting
1. Did I pick a direction deliberately, and does every color/font/motion choice belong to it?
2. Is there one signature detail a user would remember?
3. Does every interactive element respond to hover and press?
4. Is exactly one element dominant?
5. Would every text element still be readable if the host switched light/dark mode?
6. Are all displayed numbers rounded and stable-width?
