# Imagine — Visual Creation Suite

## Modules
Call read_me again with the modules parameter to load detailed guidance:
- `diagram` — SVG flowcharts, structural diagrams, illustrative diagrams
- `mockup` — UI mockups, forms, cards, dashboards
- `interactive` — interactive explainers with controls
- `chart` — charts and data analysis (includes Chart.js)
- `art` — illustration and generative art
Pick the closest fit. The module includes all relevant design guidance.
(Where module text mentions `imagine_html` / `imagine_svg`, it means your widget_code output — an HTML fragment or a raw `<svg>` fragment respectively.)

You create rich visual content — SVG diagrams/illustrations and HTML interactive widgets — that renders inline in conversation.

## Design philosophy

- **Crafted**: every widget is a small, deliberately designed artifact. It should look like a designer made it for this exact topic — not like a template was filled in.
- **Expressive**: style follows subject. A chemistry simulation, a poem, and a P&L chart should not look like siblings. Pick an aesthetic direction (below) that matches the content's mood before writing any code.
- **Clear first**: expressiveness never beats legibility. One idea, shown sharply, with the styling amplifying it — decoration that competes with the content gets cut.
- **Compact**: show the essential inline. Explain the rest in the response text.
- **Text goes in your response, visuals go in the tool** — explanatory prose, introductions, and summaries belong OUTSIDE the tool call. The widget contains only the visual element and its own labels/controls.

## Aesthetic directions — pick ONE before coding

This is mandatory. Choose the direction whose mood matches the subject; commit to it fully; never blend two. Different topics across a conversation should land on different directions — sameness is a failure mode.

**`lab-dark` — precision instrument.** Physics/chemistry/algorithm simulations; particles, fields, waves; anything animated on a stage.
- Surface: root panel `#0D1322`, `border-radius: 16px`, `padding: 20px`; faint gridlines `rgba(148,163,184,.08)`
- Ink: `#E2E8F0` primary, `#94A3B8` muted · Accents (max 2): cyan `#22D3EE`, magenta `#F472B6`, amber `#FBBF24`
- Type: mono readouts (`ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Mono', Consolas, monospace`) with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`; sans labels
- Motion: state 120ms linear; layout 350ms `cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)`
- Signature: glow on live elements (`box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(34,211,238,.45)` or canvas shadowBlur), hairline tick rulers along axes

**`paper-editorial` — warm print.** Poetry, literature, history, philosophy, language, storytelling.
- Surface: panel `#FAF6EE` (`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`: `#221E18`), ink `#272420` (dark `#E8E2D6`)
- Accents: terracotta `#C2410C`, moss `#4D7C0F`
- Type: serif display (`Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif`) 26–32px for the lead element; body 16px / line-height 1.75
- Motion: 450ms opacity/transform fades only; nothing bounces
- Signature: 1px hairline rules `#D6CDBD`, an oversized serif quotation mark or drop cap, generous margins

**`studio-pop` — gallery poster.** Art, design, music, creative showcases, playful or kid-facing topics.
- Surface: `#FFFFFF` (dark `#18181B`) with large geometric color blocks
- Accents (pick 2): electric blue `#2563EB`, lemon `#FDE047`, hot coral `#FB7185`, mint `#5EEAD4`
- Type: sans 700 display, `letter-spacing: -0.02em`, oversized numerals
- Motion: snappy 160ms ease-out; hover lifts the element
- Signature: 2–3px solid borders, hard offset shadows (`box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 #18181B`), circular badges

**`terminal-data` — trading desk.** Finance, metrics, performance, engineering dashboards, logs.
- Surface: panel `#15171C`; or light variant `#F8FAFC` with ink `#0F172A`
- Ink: `#D1D5DB` · positive `#34D399`, negative `#F87171`, neutral accent `#60A5FA`
- Type: mono numerals, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`; 11–12px uppercase labels with `letter-spacing: .08em`
- Motion: numbers count up 400ms; bars grow 400ms ease-out; zero decorative motion
- Signature: 1px dotted gridlines `rgba(148,163,184,.25)`, sparklines, ▲/▼ deltas in semantic color

**`soft-organic` — field notebook.** Biology, nature, health, food, environment, emotions.
- Surface: cream `#FBF9F4` (dark `#1F231F`); shapes in sage `#84A98C`, clay `#E07A5F`, pine `#3A5A50`
- Type: sans, roomy spacing
- Motion: 500ms ease-in-out; slow breathing loops (`transform: scale(1)↔scale(1.03)`) for living things
- Signature: blob radii (`border-radius: 58% 42% 55% 45% / 48% 55% 45% 52%`), layered translucent circles, leaf/petal accents drawn as SVG paths

**`blueprint` — engineer's drawing.** Architecture, mechanics, hardware, how-things-work cutaways.
- Surface: pale grid `#F4F7FB` with ink `#1E4D8C` (dark: `#0C1D33` with ink `#9DC2EB`)
- Accent: one warm highlight `#D97706` for the active part
- Type: mono labels with `letter-spacing: .05em`; 12px dimension numerals
- Motion: 200ms linear; parts slide along axes (transform only)
- Signature: dashed construction lines (`stroke-dasharray: 6 4`), measurement arrows with end ticks, corner crop marks

**`host-calm` — quiet native.** Data records, forms, settings mockups, comparison cards — UI that should read as part of the app.
- Surface: transparent root; cards `var(--color-background-primary)`, `0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary)`, `border-radius: var(--border-radius-lg)`
- Ink: `var(--color-text-primary)` / `var(--color-text-secondary)` · Accents: host semantic vars + the 9 SVG color ramps
- Type: `var(--font-sans)`, weights 400/500
- Motion: 150ms ease; hover `var(--color-background-secondary)`; active `scale(0.98)`
- Signature: restraint — generous whitespace, hairline dividers, a single 2px accent border on the featured item

### Direction rules
- **One direction per widget.** Commit fully — palette, type, motion, and signature detail all from the same direction. Include at least one signature detail; that's what makes the widget memorable.
- **Self-contained surface.** Every direction except `host-calm` wraps ALL content in one root panel `<div>` that carries the direction's background and ink colors. Inside that panel, hardcoded hex is correct — the panel guarantees contrast in both host light/dark modes. Never mix `var(--color-text-*)` ink with a hardcoded panel background (it inverts independently and breaks).
- **`host-calm` is variable-only.** Use CSS variables everywhere; never hardcode grays or text colors — they go invisible in dark mode.
- **Reference flowcharts/structural diagrams stay `host-calm`** with the SVG ramp classes — precision content reads best quiet. Illustrative diagrams and art may take any direction.
- **A user-named style wins.** If the request names an aesthetic ("cyberpunk", "Bauhaus", "watercolor"), derive surface/ink/accents/motion in the same disciplined format instead of using the library.

## Craft rules — apply in every direction

- **Hierarchy**: exactly one dominant element per widget (the stage, the chart, the headline number). Everything else is visibly subordinate — smaller, dimmer, or set aside. If two things compete, demote one.
- **Spacing rhythm**: all gaps and padding from the 4px scale — 8/12/16/20/24/32. Whitespace groups related things; inconsistent gaps read as sloppy.
- **Interaction states**: every clickable or draggable element gets hover + active + a `transition` (~150ms). A flat dead button is the fastest way to look cheap. Sliders update their readout live; the changed value flashes or eases to its new state so the user sees cause → effect.
- **Motion discipline**: animate only `transform` and `opacity` (plus canvas redraws). Durations from the direction spec. Loops gated behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`. Motion shows behavior — flow, growth, response — never movement for its own sake.
- **Gradients, allowed but disciplined**: 2 stops, related hues (deepen or warm the same family), linear. Use for stage depth, liquid/heat/light, or a hero accent — not as a default card background. No rainbow meshes.
- **Shadows**: either layered-soft (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.08), 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.06)`) or hard-offset (studio-pop). Never one huge blurry drop shadow.
- **Color budget**: 1 surface + 1 ink + at most 2 accents + semantic green/red where meaning demands. Accents encode meaning (state, category, delta) — not decoration.
- **Numbers**: every displayed number goes through `Math.round()` / `.toFixed(n)` / `Intl.NumberFormat` — float artifacts (`0.30000000000000004`) destroy credibility. Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for anything that updates.
- **Typography**: no font below 11px. Weights 400/500 for text; 600/700 only for display numerals and headlines inside directed panels. Sentence case for labels. No webfonts — the CDN allowlist has no font origin; use the system stacks given in the direction specs or `var(--font-sans|serif|mono)`.
- **Icons**: prefer small inline SVG paths or CSS shapes over emoji. Size icons explicitly (16px standard, 24px max) — never let them inherit container font-size.
- **First paint is meaningful**: the initial render shows real content in a sensible default state — never a blank stage with "click to start".

### Beauty check — run before emitting
1. Did I pick a direction deliberately, and does every color/font/motion choice belong to it?
2. Is there one signature detail a user would remember?
3. Does every interactive element respond to hover and press?
4. Is exactly one element dominant?
5. Would every text element still be readable if the host switched light/dark mode?
6. Are all displayed numbers rounded and stable-width?

## Technical contract — hard constraints

- No DOCTYPE, `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` — output a content fragment only.
- Structure order inside widget_code: `<style>` → markup → `<script>`.
- No `<!-- comments -->` or `/* comments */` — they waste tokens.
- The widget container is `display: block; width: 100%` with transparent background; your root element fills it. Width is fluid and unknown — never hardcode pixel widths on layout containers; use `width: 100%`, `max-width`, `1fr`, `minmax(0,1fr)`. Height is content-driven — no fixed height and no `overflow: hidden` on the root.
- Never use `position: fixed` — the iframe sizes itself to in-flow content height, so fixed elements collapse it. For modal/overlay mockups, build a faux viewport: a normal-flow `<div style="min-height: 400px; background: rgba(0,0,0,.45); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">` with the modal inside.
- No nested scrolling — let height grow to fit. Ranked/score lists render only the top 6–8 items (never `max-height` + `overflow-y: auto`); if the data is longer, cut it and note the cut in a muted footer line.
- Scripts execute after the fragment is in the DOM. Load libraries via `<script src="...">` (UMD globals), then use the global in a plain `<script>` that follows.
- **CDN allowlist (CSP-enforced)**: external resources may ONLY load from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `esm.sh`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com`. Anything else silently fails — including Google Fonts.
- Canvas does not resolve `var(--color-*)` in fillStyle/strokeStyle — use hardcoded hex on canvas (fine inside a self-contained panel).
- `grid-template-columns: 1fr` children need `minmax(0,1fr)` to clamp min-content overflow.
- Multi-column layouts: set `align-items: start` on the grid/flex container. The default `stretch` inflates a panel past its content — a square SVG inside a stretched wrapper leaves a dead band below the drawing.
- Balance column heights: in a stage + sidebar layout, estimate both columns' heights before coding; if the sidebar runs much taller than the stage, move its bottom card below the stage at full width instead of letting the stage panel stretch.
- The title gets its own row. Never pair a title with a wide control cluster in one non-wrapping flex row — the title gets crushed into vertical wrapping on narrow hosts. Controls live in their own full-width wrap row below the title.
- A small data-space viewBox (e.g. `0 0 100 100`) scales stroke-width and text up with the container — hairlines render fat and blurry. Add `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"` to hairlines, or use a pixel-scale viewBox (`0 0 680 H`) and map data coordinates onto it.

### Host CSS variables (for `host-calm` and as neutral fallbacks)
**Backgrounds**: `--color-background-primary` (white), `-secondary` (surfaces), `-tertiary` (page bg), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`
**Text**: `--color-text-primary` (black), `-secondary` (muted), `-tertiary` (hints), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`
**Borders**: `--color-border-tertiary` (0.15α, default), `-secondary` (0.3α, hover), `-primary` (0.4α), semantic `-info/-danger/-success/-warning`
**Typography**: `--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono`
**Layout**: `--border-radius-md` (8px), `--border-radius-lg` (12px), `--border-radius-xl` (16px)
All auto-adapt to light/dark mode.

**Dark mode is mandatory** — every widget must read correctly in both host modes:
- Directed widgets (self-contained panel): the panel carries its own background, so it looks identical in both modes. Light-surface directions (paper-editorial, soft-organic, blueprint-light, studio-pop) should ship the dark variant via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` using the values in the direction spec.
- `host-calm` widgets: CSS variables only — they invert automatically.
- In SVG with ramp classes: use `c-blue`, `c-teal`, etc. for colored nodes and `t`/`ts`/`th` on every `<text>` — they handle both modes automatically.
- Mental test: if the host background were near-black, would every text element still be readable?

### sendPrompt(text)
A global function that sends a message to chat as if the user typed it. Use it when the user's next step benefits from the assistant thinking. Handle filtering, sorting, toggling, and calculations in JS instead.

### Links
`<a href="https://...">` works — clicks open the host's link-confirmation dialog. Or call `openLink(url)` directly.

## When nothing fits
Pick the closest module use case and adapt. When nothing fits cleanly:
- Explanatory content → editorial layout (paper-editorial or host-calm)
- A bounded object (record, receipt, card) → host-calm card layout
- All craft rules and the technical contract still apply
- Use `sendPrompt()` for any action that benefits from assistant reasoning


**Complexity budget — hard limits (diagrams):**
- Box subtitles: ≤5 words. Detail goes in click-through (`sendPrompt`) or the prose below — not the box.
- Colors: ≤2 ramps per diagram. If colors encode meaning (states, tiers), add a 1-line legend. Otherwise use one neutral ramp.
- Horizontal tier: ≤4 boxes at full width (~140px each). 5+ boxes → shrink to ≤110px OR wrap to 2 rows OR split into overview + detail diagrams.

If you catch yourself writing "click to learn more" in prose, the diagram itself must ACTUALLY be sparse. Don't promise brevity then front-load everything.

## SVG setup

**ViewBox safety checklist** — before finalizing any SVG, verify:
1. Find your lowest element: max(y + height) across all rects, max(y) across all text baselines.
2. Set viewBox height = that value + 40px buffer.
3. Find your rightmost element: max(x + width) across all rects. All content must stay within x=0 to x=680.
4. For text with text-anchor="end", the text extends LEFT from x. If x=118 and text is 200px wide, it starts at x=-82 — outside the viewBox. Increase x or use text-anchor="start".
5. Never use negative x or y coordinates. The viewBox starts at 0,0.
6. Flowcharts/structural only: for every pair of boxes in the same row, check that the left box's (x + width) is less than the right box's x by at least 20px. If four 160px boxes plus three 20px gaps sum to more than 640px, the row doesn't fit — shrink the boxes or cut the subtitles, don't let them overlap.

**SVG setup**: `<svg width="100%" viewBox="0 0 680 H">` — 680px wide, flexible height. Set H to fit content tightly — the last element's bottom edge + 40px padding. Don't leave excess empty space below the content. Safe area: x=40 to x=640, y=40 to y=(H-40). Background transparent. **Do not wrap the SVG in a container `<div>` with a background color** — the widget host already provides the card container and background. Output the raw `<svg>` element directly.

**The 680 in viewBox is load-bearing — do not change it.** It matches the widget container width so SVG coordinate units render 1:1 with CSS pixels. With `width="100%"`, the browser scales the entire coordinate space to fit the container: `viewBox="0 0 480 H"` in a 680px container scales everything by 680/480 = 1.42×, so your `class="th"` 14px text renders at ~20px. The font calibration table below and all "text fits in box" math assume 1:1. If your diagram content is naturally narrow, **keep viewBox width at 680 and center the content** (e.g. content spans x=180..500) — do not shrink the viewBox to hug the content. This applies equally to inline SVGs inside `imagine_html` steppers and widgets: same `viewBox="0 0 680 H"`, same 1:1 guarantee.

**viewBox height:** After layout, find max_y (bottom-most point of any shape, including text baselines + 4px descent). Set viewBox height = max_y + 20. Don't guess.

**text-anchor='end' at x<60 is risky** — the longest label will extend left past x=0. Use text-anchor='start' and right-align the column instead, or check: label_chars × 8 < anchor_x.

**One SVG per tool call** — each call must contain exactly one <svg> element. Never leave an abandoned or partial SVG in the output. If your first attempt has problems, replace it entirely — do not append a corrected version after the broken one.

**Style rules for all diagrams**:
- Every `<text>` element must carry one of the pre-built classes (`t`, `ts`, `th`). An unclassed `<text>` inherits the default sans font, which is the tell that you forgot the class.
- Use only two font sizes: 14px for node/region labels (class="t" or "th"), 12px for subtitles, descriptions, and arrow labels (class="ts"). No other sizes.
- No decorative step numbers, large numbering, or oversized headings outside boxes.
- No icons or illustrations inside boxes — text only. (Exception: illustrative diagrams may use simple shape-based indicators inside drawn objects — see below.)
- Sentence case on all labels.

**Font size calibration for diagram text labels** - Here's csv table to give you better sense of the Anthropic Sans font rendering width:
```csv
text, chars length, font-weight, font-size, rendered width
Authentication Service, chars: 22, font-weight: 500, font-size: 14px, width: 167px
Background Job Processor, chars: 24, font-weight: 500, font-size: 14px, width: 201px
Detects and validates incoming tokens, chars: 37, font-weight: 400, font-size: 14px, width: 279px
forwards request to, chars: 19, font-weight: 400, font-size: 12px, width: 123px
データベースサーバー接続, chars: 12, font-weight: 400, font-size: 14px, width: 181px
```

Before placing text in a box, check: does (text width + 2×padding) fit the container?

**SVG `<text>` never auto-wraps.** Every line break needs an explicit `<tspan x="..." dy="1.2em">`. If your subtitle is long enough to need wrapping, it's too long — shorten it (see complexity budget).

**Example check**: You want to put "Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)" in a rounded rect. The text is 20 characters at 14px ≈ 180px wide. Add 2×24px padding = 228px minimum box width. If your rect is only 160px wide, the text WILL overflow — either shorten the label (e.g. just "Glucose") or widen the box. Subscript characters like ₆ and ₁₂ still take horizontal space — count them.

**Pre-built classes** (already loaded in SVG widget):
- `class="t"` = sans 14px primary, `class="ts"` = sans 12px secondary, `class="th"` = sans 14px medium (500)
- `class="box"` = neutral rect (bg-secondary fill, border stroke)
- `class="node"` = clickable group with hover effect (cursor pointer, slight dim on hover)
- `class="arr"` = arrow line (1.5px, open chevron head)
- `class="leader"` = dashed leader line (tertiary stroke, 0.5px, dashed)
- `class="c-{ramp}"` = colored node (c-blue, c-teal, c-amber, c-green, c-red, c-purple, c-coral, c-pink, c-gray). Apply to `<g>` or shape element (rect/circle/ellipse), NOT to paths. Sets fill+stroke on shapes, auto-adjusts child `t`/`ts`/`th`, dark mode automatic.

**c-{ramp} nesting:** These classes use direct-child selectors (`>`). Nest a `<g>` inside a `<g class="c-blue">` and the inner shapes become grandchildren — they lose the fill and render BLACK (SVG default). Put `c-*` on the innermost group holding the shapes, or on the shapes directly. If you need click handlers, put `onclick` on the `c-*` group itself, not a wrapper.

- Short aliases: `var(--p)`, `var(--s)`, `var(--t)`, `var(--bg2)`, `var(--b)`
- Arrow marker: always include this `<defs>` at the start of every SVG:
  `<defs><marker id="arrow" viewBox="0 0 10 10" refX="8" refY="5" markerWidth="6" markerHeight="6" orient="auto-start-reverse"><path d="M2 1L8 5L2 9" fill="none" stroke="context-stroke" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></marker></defs>`
  Then use `marker-end="url(#arrow)"` on lines. The head uses `context-stroke`, so it inherits the colour of whichever line it sits on — a dashed green line gets a green head, a grey line gets a grey head. Never a colour mismatch. Do not add filters, patterns, or extra markers to `<defs>`. Illustrative diagrams may add a single `<clipPath>` or `<linearGradient>` (see Illustrative section).

**Minimize standalone labels.** Every `<text>` element must be inside a box (title or ≤5-word subtitle) or in the legend. Arrow labels are usually unnecessary — if the arrow's meaning isn't obvious from its source + target, put it in the box subtitle or in prose below. Labels floating in space collide with things and are ambiguous.

**Stroke width:** Use 0.5px strokes for diagram borders and edges — not 1px or 2px. Thin strokes feel more refined.

**Connector paths need `fill="none"`.** SVG defaults to `fill: black` — a curved connector without `fill="none"` renders as a huge black shape instead of a clean line. Every `<path>` or `<polyline>` used as a connector/arrow MUST have `fill="none"`. Only set fill on shapes meant to be filled (rects, circles, polygons).

**Rect rounding:** `rx="4"` for subtle corners. `rx="8"` max for emphasized rounding. `rx` ≥ half the height = pill shape — deliberate only.

**Schematic containers use dashed rects with a label.** Don't draw literal shapes (organelle ovals, cloud outlines, server tower icons) — the diagram is a schema, not an illustration. A dashed `<rect>` labeled "Reactor vessel" reads cleaner than an `<ellipse>` that clips content.

**Lines stop at component edges.** When a line meets a component (wire into a bulb, edge into a node), draw it as segments that stop at the boundary — never draw through and rely on a fill to hide the line. The background color is not guaranteed; any occluding fill is a coupling. Compute the stop/start coordinates from the component's position and size.

**Physical-color scenes (sky, water, grass, skin, materials):** Use ALL hardcoded hex — never mix with `c-*` theme classes. The scene should not invert in dark mode. If you need a dark variant, provide it explicitly with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` — this is the one place that's allowed. Mixing hardcoded backgrounds with theme-responsive `c-*` foreground breaks: half inverts, half doesn't.

**No rotated text**. `<defs>` may contain the arrow marker, a `<clipPath>`, and — in illustrative diagrams only — a single `<linearGradient>`. Nothing else: no filters, no patterns, no extra markers.


## Art and illustration
*"Draw me a sunset" / "Create a geometric pattern"*

Use `imagine_svg`. Same technical rules (viewBox, safe area) but here the aesthetic direction leads — studio-pop, soft-organic, paper-editorial, and lab-dark all make strong art directions, and a user-named style always wins:
- Commit to a palette before drawing: 1 background + 3–5 working hues, all hardcoded hex. Physical scenes never invert with the host theme; add a `prefers-color-scheme` dark variant only if it genuinely improves the piece.
- Fill the canvas — art should feel rich, not sparse
- Layer overlapping shapes for depth: large soft background forms → structured midground → crisp foreground details
- Up to two `<linearGradient>` defs for sky/light/water depth; otherwise flat fills layered with opacity
- Organic forms with `<path>` curves, `<ellipse>`, `<circle>`; geometric patterns with `<g transform="rotate()">` for radial symmetry
- Texture via repetition (parallel lines, dots, hatching) not raster effects
- Add one signature detail — a glow, a texture pass, an unexpected color note — that makes the piece feel authored rather than generated


## UI components

### Aesthetic
The tokens below define the `host-calm` direction — the default for records, forms, and business UI. When the widget carries a different aesthetic direction (see the direction library above), that direction's surface/ink/accent/motion spec replaces these visual tokens, while the structural guidance in this section (layout patterns, metric cards, overflow rules, number formatting) still applies.

### Tokens
- Borders: always `0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary)` (or `-secondary` for emphasis)
- Corner radius: `var(--border-radius-md)` for most elements, `var(--border-radius-lg)` for cards
- Cards: white bg (`var(--color-background-primary)`), 0.5px border, radius-lg, padding 1rem 1.25rem
- Form elements (input, select, textarea, button, range slider) are pre-styled — write bare tags. Text inputs are 36px with hover/focus built in; range sliders have 4px track + 18px thumb; buttons have outline style with hover/active. Only add inline styles to override (e.g., different width). The pre-styling is tuned for host-calm only — in a directed (self-contained panel) widget, restyle controls to match the direction: e.g. a lab-dark button gets `background:#1B2538; color:#E2E8F0; border:1px solid rgba(148,163,184,.25); border-radius:8px` with a hover brighten and active press. Range sliders especially: the host thumb is near-black and disappears on a dark panel — restyle the track (`background`) and `::-webkit-slider-thumb` (accent background + glow) explicitly.
- Buttons: pre-styled with transparent bg, 0.5px border-secondary, hover bg-secondary, active scale(0.98). If it triggers sendPrompt, append a ↗ arrow.
- **Round every displayed number.** JS float math leaks artifacts — `0.1 + 0.2` gives `0.30000000000000004`, `7 * 1.1` gives `7.700000000000001`. Any number that reaches the screen (slider readouts, stat card values, axis labels, data-point labels, tooltips, computed totals) must go through `Math.round()`, `.toFixed(n)`, or `Intl.NumberFormat`. Pick the precision that makes sense for the context — integers for counts, 1–2 decimals for percentages, `toLocaleString()` for currency. For range sliders, also set `step="1"` (or step="0.1" etc.) so the input itself emits round values.
- Spacing: use rem for vertical rhythm (1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem), px for component-internal gaps (8px, 12px, 16px)
- Box-shadows in host-calm: focus rings only (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 Npx`). Directed widgets use their direction's shadow recipe (layered-soft, glow, or hard-offset).

### Metric cards
For summary numbers (revenue, count, percentage) — surface card with muted 13px label above, 24px/500 number below. `background: var(--color-background-secondary)`, no border, `border-radius: var(--border-radius-md)`, padding 1rem. Use in grids of 2-4 with `gap: 12px`. Distinct from raised cards (which have white bg + border).

### Layout
- Editorial (explanatory content): no card wrapper, prose flows naturally
- Card (bounded objects like a contact record, receipt): single raised card wraps the whole thing
- Don't put tables here — output them as markdown in your response text

**Grid overflow:** `grid-template-columns: 1fr` has `min-width: auto` by default — children with large min-content push the column past the container. Use `minmax(0, 1fr)` to clamp.

**Table overflow:** Tables with many columns auto-expand past `width: 100%` if cell contents exceed it. In constrained layouts (≤700px), use `table-layout: fixed` and set explicit column widths, or reduce columns, or allow horizontal scroll on a wrapper.

**Physical & electrolysis simulators (canvas-first, Claude-style):** When the user needs a **cell, tank, ions, wires, bubbles, or continuous motion**, prefer **one `<canvas>`** for the whole stage (vessel, liquid, electrodes, circuit, labels, particles, gas). Use **plain HTML above/below** for: optional `h2.sr-only`, primary buttons, sliders/mode toggles, a **metric row** (2–4 cards per Metric cards above), then the canvas, then **equations / legend** in normal flow — **do not** stack equations on top of the stage with `position: absolute`. Set logical size with `width`/`height` attributes (e.g. **680×320–400**), `style="width:100%;max-width:680px;height:auto;display:block"`, drive layout and animation in JS with **one coordinate system** and **`requestAnimationFrame`**. Avoid dozens of absolutely positioned `.ion` / `.wire` divs — they break across host widths and stream order. **Never** use `width: calc(50% - Npx)` for connector segments when **N** is large (value goes **negative** in narrow widgets and lines vanish). If you must ship a DOM-only fallback, use a **single** `position: relative` stage and anchor **power + all wires + beaker** to that same box; check `bottom`+`height` fit and `overflow` clipping.

### Mockup presentation
Contained mockups — mobile screens, chat threads, single cards, modals, small UI components — should sit on a background surface (`var(--color-background-secondary)` container with `border-radius: var(--border-radius-lg)` and padding, or a device frame) so they don't float naked on the widget canvas. Full-width mockups like dashboards, settings pages, or data tables that naturally fill the viewport do not need an extra wrapper.

### 1. Interactive explainer — learn how something works
*"Explain how compound interest works" / "Teach me about sorting algorithms"*

Use `imagine_html` for the interactive controls — sliders, buttons, live state displays, charts. Keep prose explanations in your normal response text (outside the tool call), not embedded in the HTML. No card wrapper. Whitespace is the container.

```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; margin: 0 0 1.5rem;">
  <label style="font-size: 14px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Years</label>
  <input type="range" min="1" max="40" value="20" id="years" style="flex: 1;" />
  <span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; min-width: 24px;" id="years-out">20</span>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: baseline; gap: 8px; margin: 0 0 1.5rem;">
  <span style="font-size: 14px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">£1,000 →</span>
  <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 500;" id="result">£3,870</span>
</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; position: relative; height: 240px;">
  <canvas id="chart"></canvas>
</div>
```

Use `sendPrompt()` to let users ask follow-ups: `sendPrompt('What if I increase the rate to 10%?')`

### 2. Compare options — decision making
*"Compare pricing and features of these products" / "Help me choose between React and Vue"*

Use `imagine_html`. Side-by-side card grid for options. Highlight differences with semantic colors. Interactive elements for filtering or weighting.

- Use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr))` for responsive columns
- Each option in a card. Use badges for key differentiators.
- Add `sendPrompt()` buttons: `sendPrompt('Tell me more about the Pro plan')`
- Don't put comparison tables inside this tool — output them as regular markdown tables in your response text instead. The tool is for the visual card grid only.
- When one option is recommended or "most popular", accent its card with `border: 2px solid var(--color-border-info)` only (2px is deliberate — the only exception to the 0.5px rule, used to accent featured items) — keep the same background and border as the other cards. Add a small badge (e.g. "Most popular") above or inside the card header using `background: var(--color-background-info); color: var(--color-text-info); font-size: 12px; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: var(--border-radius-md)`.

### 3. Data record — bounded UI object
*"Show me a Salesforce contact card" / "Create a receipt for this order"*

Use `imagine_html`. Wrap the entire thing in a single raised card. All content is sans-serif since it's pure UI. Use an avatar/initials circle for people (see example below).

```html
<div style="background: var(--color-background-primary); border-radius: var(--border-radius-lg); border: 0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary); padding: 1rem 1.25rem;">
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; margin-bottom: 16px;">
    <div style="width: 44px; height: 44px; border-radius: 50%; background: var(--color-background-info); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 500; font-size: 14px; color: var(--color-text-info);">MR</div>
    <div>
      <p style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 15px; margin: 0;">Maya Rodriguez</p>
      <p style="font-size: 13px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); margin: 0;">VP of Engineering</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="border-top: 0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary); padding-top: 12px;">
    <table style="width: 100%; font-size: 13px;">
      <tr><td style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); padding: 4px 0;">Email</td><td style="text-align: right; padding: 4px 0; color: var(--color-text-info);">m.rodriguez@acme.com</td></tr>
      <tr><td style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); padding: 4px 0;">Phone</td><td style="text-align: right; padding: 4px 0;">+1 (415) 555-0172</td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>
```


## Color palette

9 color ramps, each with 7 stops from lightest to darkest. 50 = lightest fill, 100-200 = light fills, 400 = mid tones, 600 = strong/border, 800-900 = text on light fills.

| Class | Ramp | 50 (lightest) | 100 | 200 | 400 | 600 | 800 | 900 (darkest) |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| `c-purple` | Purple | #EEEDFE | #CECBF6 | #AFA9EC | #7F77DD | #534AB7 | #3C3489 | #26215C |
| `c-teal` | Teal | #E1F5EE | #9FE1CB | #5DCAA5 | #1D9E75 | #0F6E56 | #085041 | #04342C |
| `c-coral` | Coral | #FAECE7 | #F5C4B3 | #F0997B | #D85A30 | #993C1D | #712B13 | #4A1B0C |
| `c-pink` | Pink | #FBEAF0 | #F4C0D1 | #ED93B1 | #D4537E | #993556 | #72243E | #4B1528 |
| `c-gray` | Gray | #F1EFE8 | #D3D1C7 | #B4B2A9 | #888780 | #5F5E5A | #444441 | #2C2C2A |
| `c-blue` | Blue | #E6F1FB | #B5D4F4 | #85B7EB | #378ADD | #185FA5 | #0C447C | #042C53 |
| `c-green` | Green | #EAF3DE | #C0DD97 | #97C459 | #639922 | #3B6D11 | #27500A | #173404 |
| `c-amber` | Amber | #FAEEDA | #FAC775 | #EF9F27 | #BA7517 | #854F0B | #633806 | #412402 |
| `c-red` | Red | #FCEBEB | #F7C1C1 | #F09595 | #E24B4A | #A32D2D | #791F1F | #501313 |

**How to assign colors**: Color should encode meaning, not sequence. Don't cycle through colors like a rainbow (step 1 = blue, step 2 = amber, step 3 = red...). Instead:
- Group nodes by **category** — all nodes of the same type share one color. E.g. in a vaccine diagram: all immune cells = purple, all pathogens = coral, all outcomes = teal.
- For illustrative diagrams, map colors to **physical properties** — warm ramps for heat/energy, cool for cold/calm, green for organic, gray for structural/inert.
- Use **gray for neutral/structural** nodes (start, end, generic steps).
- Use **2-3 colors per diagram**, not 6+. More colors = more visual noise. A diagram with gray + purple + teal is cleaner than one using every ramp.
- **Prefer purple, teal, coral, pink** for general diagram categories. Reserve blue, green, amber, and red for cases where the node genuinely represents an informational, success, warning, or error concept — those colors carry strong semantic connotations from UI conventions. (Exception: illustrative diagrams may use blue/amber/red freely when they map to physical properties like temperature or pressure.)

**Text on colored backgrounds:** Always use the 800 or 900 stop from the same ramp as the fill. Never use black, gray, or --color-text-primary on colored fills. **When a box has both a title and a subtitle, they must be two different stops** — title darker (800 in light mode, 100 in dark), subtitle lighter (600 in light, 200 in dark). Same stop for both reads flat; the weight difference alone isn't enough. For example, text on Blue 50 (#E6F1FB) must use Blue 800 (#0C447C) or 900 (#042C53), not black. This applies to SVG text elements inside colored rects, and to HTML badges, pills, and labels with colored backgrounds.

**Light/dark mode quick pick** — use only stops from the table, never off-table hex values:
- **Light mode**: 50 fill + 600 stroke + **800 title / 600 subtitle**
- **Dark mode**: 800 fill + 200 stroke + **100 title / 200 subtitle**
- Apply `c-{ramp}` to a `<g>` wrapping shape+text, or directly to a `<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<ellipse>`. Never to `<path>` — paths don't get ramp fill. For colored connector strokes use inline `stroke="#..."` (any mid-ramp hex works in both modes). Dark mode is automatic for ramp classes. Available: c-gray, c-blue, c-red, c-amber, c-green, c-teal, c-purple, c-coral, c-pink.

For status/semantic meaning in UI (success, warning, danger) use CSS variables. For categorical coloring in both diagrams and UI, use these ramps.
